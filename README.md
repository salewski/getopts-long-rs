# getopts-long-rs

This is the README.md file for the `'getopts-long-rs'` project.

## Overview

The 'getopts-long-rs' project is intended to provides a [Rust][rust-lang-org]
library for parsing command line options, with a feature set inspired by
[Perl][perl-org]'s [Getopt::Long][m-cpan-golong].

Currently the project is just a stub, established to hold the
['getopts-long' namespace][crates-io-golong] on [crates.io][crates-io].

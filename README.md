# getopts-long-rs

This is the README.md file for the `'getopts-long-rs'` project.

## Overview

The 'getopts-long-rs' project is intended to provides a Rust library for
parsing command line options, with a feature set inspired by Perl's
[Getopt::Long](https://metacpan.org/pod/Getopt::Long).

Currently the project is just a stub, established to hold the ['getopts-long'
namespace](https://crates.io/crates/getopts-long) on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/).
